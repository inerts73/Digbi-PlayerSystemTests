# DigBil_DSCS_fake

	This project is a fake DSCS server for player integration tests

## Features

    1. handle three kinds of messages: campstat, mediadeploy, msg ack,
       other messages will be considered failure

    2. every message sent by DSCS can define three assertion functions called
       mediadeploy, campstat, ack to test the received messages. In addition,
       if any of the function is defined, then the test framework will
       consider that for this sent message, the associated message with the
       assertion function must be received. On the contrary, if any of them is
       not defined, the associated message should not be received. ex:

       'msg_send_by_dscs' : { ... },
       'resp' : {
           mediadeploy: function(msg) { ... },
           act: function(msg) { ... }
       }

       for this test case, when the message defined by 'msg_send_by_dscs' is
       sent, we expect to receive mediadeploy and ack messages from billboard
       ONLY! Other cases will be considerd failure

    3. multiple test cases(namely the sent message and its associated assertion
       functions ) can be concatenated together to test interleaved messages

## Usage

    ./start.sh [test_suite_file_name] # test_suite_file_name is inside test/test_suite

    export ENABLE_PUPPET_SYNC=true # true|TRUE, this will do puppet sync before starting to test

## test suite file naming convention

    they're located in test/test_suit

    1xx.js : test user-defined msgs solely
    2xx.js : test camp scheduling msgs solely
